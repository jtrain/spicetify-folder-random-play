# Random play entire playlists within a folder

So you'd like to queue up entire albums at random? Spotify is well set up for randomising individual tracks, but playing an entire album end to end at random is not possible.

Solution:

1. Create a playlist for each album and add them to a folder
2. Install this spicetify extension (information about how to set up spicetify outside the scope of this README)
3. Right click on the folder and Shuffle playlists
4. Your queue will be filled with entire albums in a random order

FAQ?
==========================
How do I set up spicetify?
---
Best explained on their github repository

My queue only has 81 songs, but I have 100s that were supposed to be queued?
---
Spotify only shows you the next 81 songs. Pagination my friend. Rest assured that they are all queued.

Why would someone want to play an entire album?
---
My guess is not many people care about albums, but I do - so I made this. Listening to an entire album end to end can be like listening to a story from start to finish.

There is an error saying it couldn't import the playlist?
---
Yes I know. I am not sure what causes it, but after 30s if you retry that problem seems to resolve itself and so I don't feel strongly enough to fix it

Sometimes the queue keeps an old track while adding all the new ones?
---
Yes I know. Again i am not sure what causes that, you could just skip to the next song, or reshuffle the playlist

Why albums as playlists inside a folder?
---
I am not sure. It seems like a good idea because spotify only allows you to add a playlist to a folder, not a naked album. If you can come up with a better idea that doesn't require creating folders and playlists let me know. I would prefer to avoid manually picking the albums each time i want to shuffle though. I just want to go to my Tay folder and right click and play all those glorious albums in full.
